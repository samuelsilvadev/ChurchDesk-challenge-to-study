ChurchDesk Front-End Challenge
===================


Hello
----------

This is a *quick* coding challenge we designed to assess your qualifications as a potential **front-end developer at ChurchDesk**. It's important to note that this is *by no means* a test. We just want to get a sense of how you **write code and solve problems**.

Getting started
-------------------

To get started with this challenge, **fork this repository**. We provided you with a *basic structure* to help you get off the ground. You can of course delete everything and start from scratch, if that's what you want.

**Run the project**

```sh
npm install && npm start
```


What does it involve?
-------------------

This challenge involves working with the **GitHub API** to create a *Single-Page Application (SPA)* by using HTML, CSS and Javascript, that reads specific parts of the API and displays the data in an organised way.

> **GitHub API:** [https://developer.github.com/v3](https://developer.github.com/v3)

We recommend you to begin with studying the **GitHub API documentation** and choosing a specific API to work with. It is completely up to you what data you choose to work with and how you want to display it, but to get you started, here are some things you could look into:

> **Tip:** A good one to try out is the Users API.

 - displaying a list of GitHub users (limit it to whatever number you want)
 - searching for a GitHub user based on a given query
 - viewing detailed information about a specific user (e.g. followers, repos)

Additional information
-------------------

Feel free to use any *modern frameworks* you would like to achieve this. Apart from this, here are some things for you to consider in the process:

* adopting a *component-based* structure
* managing dependencies using a *package manager*
* automating tasks using a *task runner*
* making use of *ES2015 (ES6) features*
* **show your best!**

It shouldnâ€™t take you more than **6 hours** to achieve this. In any case, we expect you to get back to us 24 hours after you've forked the project.

**Good luck,**
ChurchDesk Developers
